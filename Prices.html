                    <p>I want to thank Josh because he was exactly what I needed. Every time I went to see him he would encourage me and as a result I left the gym feeling happier and stronger. He gave me the perfect balance of understanding of my circumstances, but also pushing me each time so I did not make excuses. Josh was amazingly diligent when I had questions. For example, if I had a dinner out, He would immediately look for the restaurant and the menu and always gave me advice with a positive outlook. He would tell me all the things I could eat instead of focusing on what I should not.</p>
                    <p>His warm and happy personality made every appointment a real pleasure. Thank you to Josh Jones for your outstanding personal training.</p>

                   <p>After going to my first consultation, Josh understood my goals and we got to work. I found the programme rather inspiring as I ate regularly, very well at meal times and still found it easy to shed unwanted fat in the gym.</p>
                    <p>Josh's advice and meal plans were easy to understand and follow, with an amount of flexibility so that I found it natural to only concentrate on the variety of food I am allowed to eat. Personal training sessions and telephone calls were very helpful and it was always a real boost to see the results at a weigh in. I found Josh's encouragement and enthusiasm so infectious I would have been mortified if I had let him down by the temptation to eat something I shouldn't.</p>
                    <p>I felt it was a team effort with high praise a meaningful reward. It is now a new way of life.</p>

                    <p>Having seen my weight fluctuate over the years and having reached the big 50 I was really looking for sensible diet and fitness advice that worked. A couple of friends recommended the Josh Jones Method to me so I decided to give it a go. I was not disappointed! Gently guided by the wonderful Mr Jones, I lost a stone in weight and am now in a size 8 for the first time in years. Josh was a charming and knowledgeable support who made it all very easy to understand and who encouraged me throughout the 12 week programme. I can't recommend highly enough the principles Josh Jones espouses. If you want to lose weight ,and keep it off, in a simple and effective way then this is the right step for you.</p>
