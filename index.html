                                <h2>Eye Ulcer</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Our first in patient was Benson.   He was presented at 5 months old still with his mother.   His right eye was closed and he had what appeared to be puss running from the corner of the eye.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Ulcer.jpg" alt="Eye Ulcer">
                                <p>On examination it was clearly more serious than a case of conjunctivitis.   There was a large ulcer on the front of his eye, the cornea, which had become infected with a type of bacteria which was melting his eye.   This is an emergency where a couple of hours longer could have resulted in Benson losing the eye.   Most injuries heal through molecules travelling in a good blood supply.   There is no blood supply to the cornea as a series of vessels running across the front of the eye would impede vision.   This means that when the cornea is injured, blood vessels must grow across to the site of damage and this can take several days.   Most treatment is supportive until the eye can repair itself.</p>
                                <p>Benson’s eye was so seriously injured and complicated by infection that it was literally about to “pop”!   The intense pain in eye injuries causes the horse to close it tightly; there is also excess tear production and inflammation within the eye itself.   Benson and his mother were taken up to the clinic facilities at Hatters Farm where his treatment began.</p>
                                <p>He received antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs in the form of drops.   As well as a drug to open his pupil this helps with pain relief, also in drops.   These were administered every hour day and night.   As well as the drugs we also took blood from Benson and separated the red blood cells and clotting factors which are no use, this leaves the serum which is useful in slowing the degeneration of the cornea until a blood supply can reach the ulcer.   The serum was added to the eye at the same time as the other drugs.</p>
                                <p>Benson was treated intensively for several weeks before recovering.   There was the possibility he could lose the eye at any time if he had not responded to the drugs and treatment given.   He now has approximately 50% vision in the affected eye due to a large scar across the front of his cornea but it causes him no pain or discomfort.</p>
                                <p>The eye is a unique sense organ for which there are no spare parts.   It is protected well by the eyelids and production of tears but it is often the body’s response to, or infection of, a relatively minor injury which causes the severe pain and risk of loss of sight seen quite often.</p>
                                <p>Eye problems should be considered an emergency.   Therefore it is always worth calling, even if just for advice, as a couple of hours can make all the difference.</p>
                                <p>Benson was lucky.   If his owner had been less vigilant and Benson hadn’t been seen until the following day, he would probably have lost the eye.</p>

                                <h2>Navicular Disease</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Boris is a dutch gelding who presented with a sudden onset right forelimb lameness subsequently diagnosed and under treatment for Navicular Disease.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/navicular-horse-hoof.jpg" alt="Navicular Disease">
                                <p>Navicular Disease is a complex condition which involves damage to the navicular bone, the coffin joint, tendon and ligaments. It is a problem that can affect all four feet but is really only considered in the front feet. There is a definite hereditary conformation predisposition with Thoroughbreds being over represented and Arabs rarely affected, typically low heel and long toe foot conformation contributes as well as contracted feet.</p>
                                <p>The visual presentation is a horse over 4 years old with an intermittent fore limb lameness which initially responds to a few days box rest and is worse the day after hard work.   It is commonly suspected to be coming from the shoulder by the horses owner because of the obviously shortened stride in the more severely affected limb, usually both limbs are affected one worse so than the other. The disease progresses to a stage where the horse is lame most days and lameness is aggravated by work and turn out. Often the horse lands the affected leg toe first to avoid the pain in the heel, even to the point that the toe becomes very badly bruised and confuses the diagnosis as this itself is painless. Navicular disease affects a number of structures situated close to the navicular bone. The bone itself becomes weakened as it thins in specific areas due to 2 processes. Firstly a reduced blood supply caused by clots in the arterioles supplying the bone and secondly increased bone turnover by specialist cells that remove the bone. The poor confirmation seen in many cases contributes to damage to the deep digital flexor tendon which is put under increased pressure and degenerative joint disease of the distal interphilangeal joint (coffin joint).   There is also a ligament between the navicular bone and the pedal bone which is damaged in navicular disease.</p>
                                <p>A diagnosis of navicular disease normally requires both a response to nerve blocks (palmer digital or navicular bursal) and significant x-ray changes. This is because it is possible to x-ray a sound horses feet and find moderate to severe changes in the navicular bone. These animals are likely to suffer with lameness at a later date.</p>
                                <p>The classic and common radiographic changes are the large “lollipop” shaped defects in the 60 degree upright view and thinning of the cortex, the dense border of the navicular bone.   The disease is progressive and will not be cured therefore the aim of treatment is to manage and remove the pain. This is addressed in several ways.   In the short term administration of anti inflammatory drugs is used alongside the more long term aids including corrective showing and more specific drugs. Egg bar shoes are the basis of any successful treatment, providing the correct balanced support for the feet ideally controls 100% of the pain.   Another common component of treatment is Isoxuprine (Navilox) which is a drug used to increase the blood flow to the navicular bone based on the theory that the disease is at least partially cause   by a reduced blood flow to the bone. There is also an injectable drug available which is designed to slow the breakdown of bone by the body.   If an affected horse responds to the initial treatment it will be for a variable amount of time and the horse is likely to need short courses of painkillers until it eventually becomes permanently lame. This could vary between a period of weeks or years. At this point if a patient fails to respond to treatment at all there is a salvage procedure whereby the nerves to the foot are transected (a Neurectomy) immediately relieving the pain. However, in my opinion, this operation has serious welfare implications as the horse could develop neuromas (painful swellings of the nerve endings) or suffer traumatic injury to the feet and be unaware of it.</p>

                                <p>At the time he was grossly overweight and not in any work.   The combination of this and grazing the spring grass contributed to him getting one of the most preventable and painful conditions of the equine foot, grass associated laminitis.   The contributing factors are typical and I see dozens of cases every year, overweight horses on high sugar, new growth grass, with the extremely common misunderstanding that field turnout is equivalent to exercise – it is not.</p>
                                <p>Dylan was immediately put on strict box rest with restricted hay and daily anti inflammatory drugs but after just 5 days he had deteriorated and needed his front feet x-raying and corrective heart bar shoes fitted to support the inflamed tissue in his feet.   The shoes are refitted every 4-5 weeks and Dylan was maintained on box rest.   Approximately 2 months later Dylan deteriorated again and on x-ray his pedal bones had rotated and sunk even further so that there was about 3-4mm of sole before his pedal bones came through and were exposed.   At this point his prognosis was grave.   We decided to remove some of the front of his hooves, dorsal wall resection, to try to relieve some of the pressure inside the feet caused by gas that builds up as the bone and hoof separate.   Now Dylan was having heart bar shoes fitting regularly and daily bandaging of the hoof resection sites.</p>
                                <p>Towards the end of 2004 one hoof was obviously more painful than the other and we decided that he would benefit from the shoe on the more painful foot being filled with a liquid plastic material for even more support.   The material hardens as it is exposed to the air and mixed with a hardener and simply acts an extension of the horse or pony’s sole, making it thicker and therefore more supportive.</p>
                                <p>Dylan has just started small walks at the end of February 2005 with normal shoes refitted after nearly 9 months of box rest.   He is still on a reduced dose of anti inflammatory drugs for a condition which, in his case, could have been prevented.   He has lost weight and will go back into work soon thanks to the vigilant owner in Claire, who was always aware of small changes in his condition which was important, and patient, professional shoeing by Peter Lamb.</p>
                                <p>There are many causes of laminitis, some difficult to predict and prevent, and some incredibly easy to prevent.   With the amount of information available to owners through magazines, informed feed merchants, qualified farriers and veterinary surgeons, there is no excuse for someone who turns an overweight, or even healthy weight, horse or pony in a lush pasture 24 hours a day throughout the summer without regular exercise.  Remember field turnout is not exercise!</p>

                                <h2>Sarcoids</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Bailey is a seven year old, Anglo Arab gelding with a promising showing career ahead of him. He has had a very successful novice season competing hack and Anglo/part bred Arab classes culminating in Reserve British National Champion Ridden Anglo Arab 2008. His owner was very concerned, as he had recently developed a number of unusual skin lumps in many different places all over his body.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/sarcoids.jpg" alt="Sarcoids">
                                <p>Skin lumps can appear for a number of reasons, and their size, shape, the place at which they are found on the body and how quickly they have appeared are all very important considerations. These factors act as small clues in identifying the lumps, why they have appeared and how they can be treated. When Bailey was examined in January 2009, he had a large number of rough, raised areas of hairless skin, which were of all different shapes and sizes on his neck and face. He also had several small, red, marble-shaped hairless lumps under his skin, between his hind legs.</p>
                                <p>Bailey’s skin lumps were identified to be sarcoids. Sarcoids are a form of skin cancer that is, unfortunately, frequently seen in horses. Although sarcoids can be found on any area of the body, they often appear on hairless skin and on areas where horses tend to be bitten by flies, for example on their face, between their forelegs and on the insides of their hind legs, as in Bailey’s case. Sarcoids can also appear on wounds where they can slow down or even stop wounds from healing. The reason as to why horses develop sarcoids is not fully understood, but it is thought that flies transmit cells that are infected with a virus called ‘bovine papilloma virus’ to horses and this triggers the sarcoid to grow. The virus has absolutely no connection to horses being kept alongside cows, despite its name.</p>
                                <p>Sarcoids appear in all different shapes and sizes and are categorised into six types: nodular, verrucose, occult, fibroblastic, malevolent and mixed. Bailey had developed nodular sarcoids (which look like red marbles) between his hind legs and a number of mixed-type sarcoids (the rough raised areas of skin) on both sides of his neck, face and at the base of his right ear.</p>
                                <p>It is very important to consider treatment for sarcoids. Untreated sarcoids will grow bigger with time and can be a welfare consideration in horses. Sarcoids can easily devalue a horse, reduce its performance and even make the horse impossible to sell. Some horses can suffer sarcoids to such as extent that they are put to sleep on welfare grounds.</p>
                                <p>There are many different treatment options available for different types of sarcoids. Our first step was to carefully examine each of Bailey’s sarcoids to identify which types they were so that we could devise a treatment plan. Sarcoid treatment is not only quite expensive, but it is also a large under-taking for Bailey and his owner to experience. There is no guarantee that any of the treatment options will be successful in removing the sarcoids and there is always a chance that the sarcoids could re-grow at a later point in time. It is also important to consider that the treatment could leave scars, which in Bailey’s case would not bear well for his showing career.</p>
                                <p>It was decided that the best way to treat the nodular sarcoids on the insides of Bailey’s hind legs, would be to ‘ligate’ them. Ligation involves placing a small but extremely strong rubber band around the base of each of the nodular-type of sarcoids. This method of treatment cuts off the sarcoid’s blood supply and after several weeks the sarcoid drops off. We decided that the best way of treating the mixed-types of sarcoids on Bailey’s neck and face would be with ‘AW4 cream’. In order to do this we had to photograph all of the sarcoids that we were intending to treat, and then send them to Professor Knottenbelt at the University of Liverpool who is an expert in the treatment of sarcoids amongst other things. The University of Liverpool Sarcoid Department supplies the AW4 cream. The cream is ‘cytotoxic’ which means that it kills any body cells, regardless as to whether they are healthy or diseased. Consequently it was very important that Bailey stood still whilst the cream was applied to avoid treating any healthy skin cells surrounding the sarcoids. Several applications of the cream were needed over a number of weeks to complete the full course of treatment.</p>
                                <p>Other therapies that are available for sarcoid treatment include surgical removal, cryosurgery, laser therapy, and BCG treatment. The location of Bailey’s sarcoids would make surgical removal, cryosurgery and laser therapy very difficult to carry out and there would be a high risk of scarring. BCG treatment was not an appropriate choice for treating Bailey, and it is usually used as a last resort to treat sarcoids around horses’ eyes. It involves injecting a series of BCG injections directly into the sarcoid. This is a very risky procedure, as horses can suffer potentially fatal adverse reactions to the injections.</p>
                                <p>After several weeks of treatment, the nodular-type sarcoids that had been ligated had dropped off and the skin was healing well. The mixed-type sarcoids that were treated with the cytotoxic cream made excellent progress. The larger sarcoids reduced in size and the skin is healing very well around the areas where smaller sized sarcoids were found. Given the extent of Bailey’s sarcoids and the aggressive treatment schedule that he had to endure, we are very pleased with his progress. There is lots of evidence to show that after sarcoids have been treated, competition horses show an improvement in their performance. By May 2009 Bailey’s skin was fully healed and he and his owner enjoyed another busy showing season this year.</p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Harrison was born on 28th March 2006 and unfortunately lost his mother when he was just hours old. Fortunately he was a strong, precocious foal and had drunk plenty of colostrums before his mother had died. There was now an immense job ahead for his owner.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/orphaned-foal.jpg" alt="Orphaned Foal">
                                <p>We immediately contacted the National Foaling Bank who match foster mares with orphaned foals, as this is the most favourable option. At that time there were no suitable mares available for Harrison but the National Foaling Bank was on standby as were other local veterinary practices to call us if a suitable mare became available.</p>
                                <p>Harrison ’s owner began the unenviable job of bottle-feeding him every hour with powdered milk obtained from a local stud. Harrison was watched closely at all times for any sign of weakness or disease but he thrived against the odds and when he was one week old (which was a very long week for his owner), we received a call from the National Foaling Bank to say that a possible surrogate mare had become available.</p>
                                <p>Daffodil, a shire mare, had lost her own foal only the day before. We travelled Harrison to the mare and introduced them slowly.Daffodill and Harrison going out The fostering process often takes 2 or 3 days before the mare accepts the foal as her own, however, amazingly these two bonded within less than an hour!</p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Katy is a 5 year old thoroughbred mare currently owned by Sue Barton. Katy had originally been rescued by another client and was in terrible condition. She had been left in a field where there was no provision of food, water or shelter. When I first examined Katy after she was rescued she was in such poor condition I gave her a 50% chance of surviving her first week. However thankfully she made great progress and after months of careful management she was fit and well and ready to go on to some ridden work and it was then Sue bought her.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/cracked-hooves.jpg" alt="Cracked Hooves">
                                <p>Due to Katy’s severe malnutrition her hooves had been of very poor quality with several cracks and pieces broken off the walls and generally collapsed very flat conformation.  With the care she had received since being rescued her feet did improve but she had developed major cracks at the toes of both her fore feet. These were what are known as “grass cracks” as they started at the ground and cracked up to the coronary band. There are several factors which can contribute to the formation of these cracks including poor quality horn (genetic or diet related), foot imbalance, foot infections (seedy toe and white line disease) amongst others.</p>
                                <p>Katy’s cracked hooves were particularly bad as they extended right up to the coronary band on both feet and were starting to damage them. The result of these large cracks was that her feet were completely unstable and the two “halves” could be pulled apart several millimetres using just your hands. In most cases this will cause pain and therefore lameness and there is a greatly increased risk of bacteria entering the foot and causing abscesses.</p>
                                <p>Treatment for these hoof wall cracks can be done in a number of different ways dependant on the position of the crack and what distance it has travelled up the hoof. The majority of these type of cracks will need stabilising with a quarter clip shoe (like a “back shoe” with 2 clips) to prevent spreading at the toe.   As well as the shoe the crack can be halted by several methods.</p>

                                <p>You may be mistaken for thinking that there was something not quite right with the appearance of this newly born foals foot.   But rest assured it is quite normal and is usually the 'normal' appearance of a foals hoof after being born.   The reason for this soft rubbery slipper appearance is to protect the mare from the foal’s hooves.   If the foal, whilst still within the mare’s womb were to develop with hard, firm hooves as we are all familiar with then all it would take were a few kicks from the developing foal to traumatise if not tear the womb.   The same can be said for the actual birthing process.   If the foal were to have hard hooves then a lot of discomfort and trauma could be inflicted on the mare as the foal passes through the birth canal and vagina.   So whilst these hooves may seem a little odd, it really is a good job they develop this way.   Within a few days they will eventually harden up and the folded edges wear away as the foal moves around on firm ground.</p>

                                <p>For the September/October 2007 issue of Gallop Magazine (www.gallopmag.co.uk) we produced an article on Obesity in Horses (see Diseases/Obesity section of the website).</p>
                                <p>In this article we mentioned a condition called Hyperthermia, a condition where the horses body literally overheats because excessive heat cannot escape from its body. This happens particularly in overweight horses because the fat acts as an insulator.</p>
                                <p>We have a client, previously registered with another practice, whose horse died of this condition. They have very kindly allowed us to use this case study in the hope that it will highlight the dangers to other horse owners.</p>
                                <p>The picture you can see of Perl was taken on the Wednesday at the Royal Welsh Show. Perl died in transit going home the following Saturday. As you can see from the picture Perl was an absolutely stunning horse and not particularly overweight but carrying “show weight”.</p>
                                <p>This article is distressing and upsetting but we have featured it, in the clients own words, in the hope that people will grasp the seriousness of the situation and understand the reasons why we continually raise the issue of overweight horses and ponies with clients.</p>
                                <p>Autopsy Article for Gallop Jan/Feb Issue 2007</p>
                                <p>“We have just heard the results of the autopsy on Geler Perl, which were that Perl had several haemorrhages throughout her body, a swollen brain and skeletal disorders.</p>
                                <p>We asked our vet to explain the findings to us in ‘laymans’ terms and to be quite honest we were totally shocked to find that at the end of the day it was down to the heat.</p>
                                <p>As we went through the principle causes with our vet it became quite apparent that there were several reasons why Perl had died.</p>
                                <p>Perl was up to the weight that she needed to be to attend the Royal Welsh Show. She was not grossly fat but was carrying “show weight”. When we think about weight we often automatically worry about laminitis. The effect that this extra weight had on Perl would have never entered our heads. It had acted as an insulator, not allowing her inner body temperature to cool.</p>
                                <p>Another factor, which was high on the list, was the fact that she had been kept in a very low, small stable all week at the show. The roof consisted off metal cladding, which in effect made them operate like pressure cookers. Perl never demonstrated any signs of sweating or discomfort.</p>
                                <p>The bottom line was that this experience had been the equivalent to placing a dog in a very, very hot car, with the same devastating affects, hence the skeletal changes.</p>
                                <p>With hindsight we would have done quite a few things differently in the knowledge that we now have.</p>
                                <p>We would have made known our concerns about the roofing on the stable to the stable manager and the fact it was so small.</p>
                                <p>We would have hosed Perl down with cold water on a regular basis to keep her inner temperature at an acceptable level.</p>
                                <p>We are not looking to apportion any blame, it was just one of those freak occurrences, but we feel sure that if owners follow a few simple rules a recurrence would be avoided.</p>
                                <p>We would ask everyone, including judges, to take into consideration the weight of show animals and not have them too fat.</p>
                                <p>Please remember in very hot weather to hose them down, even if they are not illustrating signs of sweating, as was the case with Perl.</p>
                                <p>We will carry the burden of guilt for some time to come as we feel totally responsible for Perl and we would hate for you to have to lose your best friend as we did.”</p>

                                <h2>Wolf Teeth</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Apollo is a 5 year old Welsh Section D gelding. Back in August 2007 his owner reported he was having problems with his wolf teeth. The wolf teeth were unusually large and on examination it was decided they would be removed under standing sedation, which is usual.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/wolf-teeth.jpg" alt="Wolf Teeth">
                                <p>On the day of the planned extraction Apollo had other ideas! His wolf teeth were large and very difficult to remove and Apollo responded poorly to the sedation. He was given as much sedation as was considered safe whilst leaving him standing, but this did not deter him from strongly resisting even with mild pressure. Apollo’s objections were noted and it was decided and agreed with the owner that the safest and least traumatic way of removing the teeth would be under general anaesthetic.</p>
                                <p>The procedure went very smoothly and the teeth removed successfully. Apollo recovered extremely well.</p>
                                <p>Wolf teeth are variable in size and appearance and can be completely absent in some horses. More often than not they are only present in the upper jaw (maxilla) but some breeds, especially standard breds, can have them in the lower jaw (mandible).</p>
                                <p>They are located just in front of the first premolar in the position of the bit and therefore can interfere with the seating of the bit. This is why they are routinely removed.</p>
                                <p>More often than not, this is a straightforward procedure and can be done under standing sedation. It can take time and ideally the tooth should be removed as a whole. The tooth is loosened from the attached gum and an instrument similar to an apple corer is used to slowly work the tooth free from its attachments with the jaw.</p>
                                <p>The procedure does cause trauma to the gum and bleeding is common place. This is self limiting and stops on its own afterwards. Inevitably the wound will heal uneventfully over a week or so.</p>
                                <p>Very occasionally it can be necessary to perform this procedure under general anaesthesia, for example, if the horse did not tolerate the sedation and it was proving difficult or painful to perform, or if the wolf teeth were particularly large / firmly placed and difficult to remove.</p>
                                <p>Field anaesthesia is a relatively commonplace procedure and can be used to perform minor surgical procedures such as tooth removals or castrations on larger / older colts. These are procedures that require only a short period of general anaesthetic. Anything that requires longer periods of anaesthesia and the associated close monitoring should be performed in an operating theatre.</p>
                                <p>Anaesthetising a horse in the field is a straightforward procedure. Initially the horse is sedated and moved to the area of ‘knocking down’. This area should be dry and free from hazardous obstacles. A catheter is placed in the jugular vein. Once the horse is thoroughly sedated an injection of anaesthetic is given via the catheter, usually this is a combination of anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant. Within 30 seconds the horse should gently sit down and then lie down on one side. As you can imagine this is a dangerous time as horses are such large animals and under these circumstances could potentially stumble over and fall on somebody. It is for this reason that during this time the vets will be the only people with the horse whilst the owner can observe from a safe distance.</p>
                                <p>Once asleep the horses eyes are covered so the light doesn’t stimulate it too much and lighten the depth of the anaesthesia. The procedure can then be performed safely whilst ensuring the anaesthetic is maintained and the horse isn’t awakening. This initial anaesthetic provides on average 12 minutes of adequate anaesthesia. If more time is needed then a top up injection of the anaesthetic is given to provide a further 12 minutes.</p>
                                <p>Once the procedure has been completed the horse is given painkillers and antibiotics as necessary and the vets are on hand to wait for the horse to wake up and recover smoothly. This again is a very dangerous period, not for the horse, but for the owner as some horses may try to stand up too quickly, before their legs can hold them and they may stumble around. Once again the vets are the only people with the horse at this stage with the owner observing from a safe distance.</p>

                                <h2>Twin Foals</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Meet the twins (yet to be named), together with proud mum Katy, a grey Sports Horse mare. These two adorable and very lucky youngsters are now over 6 months old. It is remarkable that they both survived, never mind that they are so well grown and similar in size. They are owned by Billy Hartley in Astley and I am sure he is looking forward to competing in the ridden pairs when these two are ready!</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Twins.jpg" alt="Twin Foals">
                                <p>It is unusual to see a healthy pair of twin foals as pictured. Indeed it is exceptionally rare that both twins survive the pregnancy let alone to have both born and survive. The usual outcome would be that the weaker twin would either be stillborn or in a very weak state and wouldn’t survive very long after it was born. It would also not be surprising if the stronger twin presented with problems due to a lower birth weight and ultimately die. In some situations the twin pregnancy is unknown as the pregnancy fails and the embryos are reabsorbed during the pregnancy. Some may abort the twins at 7/8 months of gestation.</p>
                                <p>As can be imagined, the reason for this poor outcome is that the foals compete for space and nutrients within the mare’s womb. It is an immense drain on the mare’s energy reserves to try and sustain and nourish two developing foals and consequently preference is given to one of the foals to receive more nutrients and space than the other.</p>
                                <p>It cannot be stressed enough how dangerous and potentially life threatening it is for a mare to be having twins.</p>
                                <p>Whilst working in New Zealand , I was called to a mare that was having difficulty in foaling. The mare was thought to be only having a single foal as is normal, she hadn’t been scanned to prove otherwise. The foal’s head was presenting along with only one leg. The mare had also prolapsed approximately one foot of her rectum; this gave the mare a very poor prognosis for survival even if she foaled normally. As I tried to feel inside the mare and free the foals twisted leg I could feel another head which was effectively blocking the foals trapped leg and leaving me unable to push the foal back to create more space. Unfortunately, the first foal, which was already in a weakened state died and the mare, was put to sleep given the hopeless situation she was in. Even if the foals could be removed she had a hopeless prognosis afterwards, given the prolapsed rectum. A post-mortem was performed and the second foal had indeed wedged itself into the mare’s pelvic canal, thus causing the first foal to be stuck in both directions. This was a very upsetting situation and a devastating outcome for both mare and owner. It only serves to highlight the danger associated with a twin pregnancy in horses.</p>
                                <p>This situation can be prevented by simply having your mare ultrasound scanned after covering to detect a twin pregnancy. The ultimate time for this to be performed is 14-16 days after the mare was covered. This will not only confirm that conception has occurred but will also allow detection of a twin pregnancy.</p>
                                <p>If a twin pregnancy is imaged then there are three possible courses of action. Firstly one of the embryos can be popped using the ultrasound scanner. This requires a relative amount of skill at this early stage of pregnancy and isn’t without its risks as it can also inadvertently destroy the other embryo too. Secondly the pregnancy can be left until 30 days of gestation, as this will give the mare time to naturally reabsorb one of the embryos as this can commonly occur with twin pregnancies. The final option at either stage of gestation is to administer a drug, which will abort both embryos. The mare can then be put back into heat and bred again. If the pregnancy goes beyond 37 days and twins are still present then the situation is much more difficult to control and the pregnancy may have to be left to run its course whilst keeping fingers and toes crossed.</p>

                                <h2>Lymphangitis</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Eros is a 10 year old Dutch warmblood gelding. In July 2008 his owner, Karen, called the practice as an emergency as one of his legs was swollen. On arrival his left hind leg was extremely swollen from the coronary band to above his stifle. There was a total loss of definition and there was so much pressure within the limb that serum was being forced through his skin and running down the leg at numerous points. He was not weight bearing on the leg and was showing signs of considerable pain.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Lymphangitis.jpg" alt="Lymphangitis">
                                <p>Treatment for ulcerative lymphangitis was started although there was the unlikely possibility still that he had fractured a bone high up the leg. He responded poorly to initial treatment and so we decided to refer him to the equine hospital at Leahurst for further investigation and exclusion of the fracture.</p>
                                <p>Eros was hospitalised at Leahurst for a few days where he had intensive treatment until he was comfortable enough to be managed at home. Once home he continued on the treatment and started some in hand exercise. The exercise is extremely important in reducing the swelling as the action of the muscles helps to pump fluid away from the limb. The swelling slowly reduced but not completely and it was decided that Eros needed more exercise. He was referred to Beaver Hall Equestrian Centre for physiotherapy and Spa sessions in the pool. Following this the swelling was greatly reduced and he returned home once again. This time he was able to start more intensive work and since then he has come on in leaps and bounds! The leg is not yet 100% normal but it is almost there and Karen is continuing to manage Eros’ condition really well.</p>
